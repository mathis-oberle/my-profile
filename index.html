							I am currently enrolled in the Global Bachelor in Business Administration at the ESSEC Business School. This 4-year program will provide me with a Master 1 diploma in 2025 and an in-depth knowledge in numerous subjects as well as an early professional experience with the numerous internships we will have to complete. In this program I will learn how to master managerial tools and theories, and gain insights into society and the business world. What made this program particularly attractive in my eyes is the diversity of classes, the learning-by-doing approach but most importantly, the international exposure through the inter-campus mobilities and cohort programs. Throughout this comprehensive program we are accompanied by professionals and provided with guidance by renowned professors. The strength of this academic curriculum lies in its capacity to equip us with a wide array of hard skills but also the soft skills that are becoming increasingly crucial in the professional environment.

							I obtained my baccalaureate in May 2021 after having succesfully completed the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program with "mention excellente". In this comprehensive, I specialized into economics and history and developed a critical and analytical mindset as well as research skills. During the last two years in the IBDP, I have worked on several research projects a few of which are listed below: 
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>The stakes of digitalization for the Luxembourgish healthcare sector</li>
							<li>The impact of synergies resulting from the Fiat-Chrysler-PSA deal on long and short-run average costs of the new group.</li>
							<li>Comparison of different measures of spread of data using the practical example of revenue distribution among physicians in the Luxembourgish hospitals.</li>
							<li>The collaboration between Ford and the Nazi government during the Second World War</li>
							<li>The significance of the inconsistencies of the 1947 status of Algeria </li>
						</ul>

							In April 2018, I completed a one-week internship in the Luxembourgish Chamber of Commerce in the department of economic affairs. During this first enriching professional experience, I had the opportunity to work on the widely-circulated booklet "Luxembourg in numbers", which sharpened my research skills and abilities in terms of teamwork and professional communication. Moreover, I had to write a questionnaire in which Luxembourgish business managers would be able to expose their opinion about a new law that would turn the Luxembourgish ASBLs (Associations Sans But Lucratif) into SISs (Société à Impact Sociétal). This internship introduced me to basic business concepts such as the SWOT analysis and was key in providing me an insight into the business environment. This experience certainly influenced the choice of my subsequent higher education study track.

							In April 2020 I launched a project called SOSchool with two classmates. The objective of this initiative was to provide a tutoring assistance to children from primary school with a migration background. At SOSchool, we thought these pupils to be the main indirect victims of the consecutive lockdowns and we believed that they were not paid enough attention to. Hence, we tried to rally numerous volunteering high-school students willing to tutor a child and through our close collaboration with the Luxembourgish social organisation Caritas and the Red Cross, we identified the pupils and families that required our help in priority. The main objective of the summer vacation in 2020 was to make sure that by the start of the next school year, they had catched up with the program. Indeed, Luxembourg being a country in which students are required to be fluent in four different languages, in the absence of the regular school program and parents who are proficient at these languages, many fell behind and have difficulties to keep up with their classmates. This experience was a great opportunity to contribute to the solving of a social issue and develop an entire set of new skills. Throughout this project, I had to work on my communication skills, master teamwork, find ways to energize those who worked with me and integrate strategies to overcome cultural dicrepancies. Furthermore, SOSchool confronted me to administrative challenges and initiated me to how to communicate with important partners.
